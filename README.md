## Quick start

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpoland/dotfiles/master/get.dotfiles.sh | sh

This clones the repo, downloads all the submodules, and links the vim-related dotfiles into
the current user's home directory.  Running this command should get you up and
running with this vim config without any other work.

## Make it your own

If you want to copy this Vim config as a base for your own, you should:

* Fork this repository.
* Change the mention of "tpoland" in the get.dotfiles.sh script to your own
  github name.
* Customize the vim config to suit you.

## Highlights

### Turbo Button

This Vim config supports two runtime profiles:

* Normal, with all plugins loaded.
* Minimal, with no plugins loaded. Super fast startup!

To run Vim without loading plugins use the --noplugins option.
e.g.

    vim --noplugins

I recommend setting your EDITOR environment variable to use this option:

    export EDITOR="vim --noplugin"

This way you'll have a faster startup when other programs (e.g. git) bring up
Vim.

### vimrc Organization

This Vim config (loaded from .vimrc) is broken up across several files that are
sourced.  Each file performs a different kind of customization.  For instance
one file is responsible for customizing vim settings, while another file
is responsible for defining custom key mappings.  All plugin-related
configuration is stored in it's own file that is loaded conditionally depending
on whether the --noplugins flag was used.

### Vundle

This Vim config uses the [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) plug-in
manager. Each plugin is listed in the `vim_plugin_definitions` file.

### Plugins

Take a look at the vim_bundles file to see all of the included plugins.
